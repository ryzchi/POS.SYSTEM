Point of Sale (POS) System

This Point of Sale (POS) System is a simple console-based program that allows an admin to manage a shopping cart. It includes basic functionalities such as adding, removing, viewing, and checking out items.

Features:
Admin Login - Requires a username and password before accessing the system.
Add Item - Allows the admin to input an item's name and price to add it to the cart.
Remove Item - Displays the cart's contents and lets the admin remove an item by selecting its number.
View Cart - Shows all items in the cart with their corresponding prices and total cost.
Checkout - Clears the cart after confirming the purchase.
Exit System - Allows the admin to safely close the system.

The system continuously loops through the Main Menu until the admin chooses to exit. It ensures error handling for invalid inputs and prevents operations on an empty cart. This POS system is useful for small-scale inventory and transaction management.
